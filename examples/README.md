libraries of interest: Examples
===============================

Here go the repositories which provide examples, tests, or other 'miscellaneous educational code material' for libraries or protocols we are interested in (e.g. jQuery-UI, HTML5, D3, ...). 

The stuff in here is *not* documentation, but mostly code. Then again, it is also not code that is ever meant to run on a production server, but rather is included here to serve the purpose of learning / inspiring / study.
