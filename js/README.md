libraries of interest: JavaScript
=================================

This is where you drop JS libraries (e.g. slickgrid, jQuery): focus on JavaScript (& Coffee).

If it's other, certainly non-JavaScript, code then it goes into PHP/ or TOOLING/ instead, depending on 
whether it's going to be part of the server run-time (JS + PHP) or is meant as a developer tool
(TOOLING).

CoffeeScript, TypeScript, etc. are considered 'JavaScript' in this regard (organizational perspective).
