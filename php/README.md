libraries of interest: PHP
==========================

This is where you drop PHP libraries (e.g. HTMLawed, YII): focus on PHP.

If it's JavaScript or other non-PHP code, then it goes into JS/ or TOOLING/ instead, depending on 
whether it's going to be part of the server run-time (JS + PHP) or is meant as a developer tool
(TOOLING).

That also means that *tools* written in PHP don't end up here but preferentially in TOOLING: we don't care (much) about the language but more about the purpose: server run-time or development run-time?
