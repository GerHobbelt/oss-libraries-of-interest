libraries of interest: Tooling
==============================

This is where you drop development tools (e.g. JSDoc, Docco, jison, PEGjs, ...): focus on *tools*.

The decision to drop stuff in here is depending on whether it's going to be part of 
the server run-time (JS + PHP) (**NO, DROP SOMEWHERE ELSE**) or is meant as a developer tool
(TOOLING) (**YES, OKAY**).
