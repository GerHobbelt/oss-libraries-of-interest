// Example LESS file to go with the jquery-fast-show-hide module
//

.fast-show
{
    // display: auto    -- the actual display style is determined by the application! block, inline-block, ...
}
.fast-hide
{
    display: none !important;       // added the !important so it overrules and other CSS display rules which apply to the same element.
}

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 
// And in case you are of the same mind as I where blatant use of `!important` to get your way 
// is concerned, here's the alternative:

.fast-hide
{
    //
    // WARNING: do *not* use !important as a 'quick fix' to make this bugger rule over everyone:
    // the effect of `!important` use is that *any* attempts to override/replace this one
    // require an abundance of `!important` attributes just to win over this one, creating 
    // a maintenance mess which would feature prominently as the antagonist in any 
    // Wes Craven horror flic.
    // 
    // In short: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT ABOUT USING `!important`!
    // 
    // The *proper* way out, if you need any, is to ensure the overriding style definitions have
    // CSS selectors which have precedence over this one. Yes, that might mean you need to study up on CSS
    // precedence rules, but that is a Good Thing, because once you know those, that's one less
    // warm body to throw a wrench in the CSS styling gearbox in our app. :-)
