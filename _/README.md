README
======

This is the `_` library directory tree. It contains fresh instances of each library which we use
in any of our applications / projects:

These library files are preprocessed/cleaned copies of the libraries referenced in this repository
by `git submodule`.

These library copies have been cleaned i.e. stripped of any example code, documentation files and
other surplus not required for *using* the library sources in either development or production.

Before these library files may be used in production, they should be postprocessed by the
regular fingerprint+compression process: those results should then be stored in the release
'snapshots' repository.
