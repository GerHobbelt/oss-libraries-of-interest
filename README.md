libraries_of_interest
=====================

Collects all 'submodules of interest': we use these directly or as inspirational sources. Includes scripts to 'prep &amp; install' the libraries that we actually use in our production environment so that merely loading *this* submodule gets you all the files you need in a full-fledged Visyond production environment. Has a long list of submodules.
